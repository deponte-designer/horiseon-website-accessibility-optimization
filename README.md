# Horiseon Website Accessibility Optimization

Welcome to the Horiseon Website Accessibility Optimization project repository! This repository is dedicated to enhancing the accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO) of the Horiseon website.
<br>

## Description

Horiseon, a marketing agency, recognizes the importance of providing an accessible and user-friendly website to reach a broader audience and improve search engine rankings. This project aims to achieve this goal by adhering to accessibility standards, using semantic HTML elements, ensuring a logical structure in HTML and CSS, and implementing SEO best practices. I discover the significance of web accessibility through this project, focusing on creating user-friendly websites that meet accessibility standards.

## User Story

**AS A marketing agency, I WANT** a codebase that follows accessibility standards, **SO THAT** our own site is fully optimized for search engines.
<br>


## Acceptance Criteria

This Acceptance criteria is presented in a widely recognized format known as scenario-oriented criteria.

**Given** that we are ensuring accessibility standards for the website,
**When** we inspect the source code,
**Then** the following requirements must be met:

- **When** we inspect the source code, 
**Then** Semantic HTML elements should be used extensively.

- **When** we structure HTML elements,
**Then** they must follow a logical hierarchy that is independent of styling and positioning.

- **When** we include images and icons,
**Then** they should have appropriate and informative `alt` attributes.

- **When** we arrange heading elements,
**Then** they should maintain a sequential order for content structure.

- **When** we provide a title,
**Then** it should be concise and descriptive.

## Features

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges as it was my first project. I invested a lot of time in research to implement the best methodologies. While the project is functional, there are several features I hope to implement in the future to enhance its quality and user experience:

1. **Improved Image Quality:** I plan to replace current images with higher-quality ones to enhance visual appeal.

2. **Back-to-Top Icon:** Adding a smooth "scroll to top" icon for better navigation on longer pages.

3. **Enhanced User-Friendly Interactions:** Implementing more user-friendly interactions to create a smoother browsing experience.

4. **Animations:** Incorporating subtle animations to make the static website more engaging and visually appealing.

5. **Auto Date in Footer:** Automatically updating the date in the footer, providing a more dynamic feel.

>Your support and feedback are greatly appreciated as I work on these improvements!
